# DogGame
This is the first game I created using Unity. It is based off of a sample from Unity Learn. When the project is open, run the scene "Challenge 2". To spawn a dog, press the space bar. In level 1, you can try to catch the balls and diamonds. In level 2, you can try to hit the chicks and cows.
